It’s a good problem to have in the business world. Rapid growth and expansion in our current business has the IT team that I am a part of scrambling to keep up. 
 
With 50% growth over the last 5 years the little company we support is growing in leaps and bounds. The struggles we go through range from deploying hardware at the rate of new hires, to growing our virtual server infrastructure to handle double the amount of servers that we had 6 months ago. The challenges we are facing have us asking some tough questions. How can we better manage our projects so that communication with our stakeholders, our team and our outside support? The goal being to have a greater degree of confidence in the success of our projects going in. Do we need to have a higher tier of support as we make headway into a more and more Enterprise level infrastructure? How can we analyze our effectiveness as a team? I’m sure there will be much more as we move forward. These questions are just some that we are looking at as we make transitions and grow as a company. We all should ask ourselves from time to time, “How can we improve the situation, workflow, or process”, and we are doing that more and more often.<br>
 
After the recent crash and burn of a large networking/virtualization project we were all left with a sour taste in our mouths. With a minimum of finger pointing we all threw out ideas on how to make it better. We can start with our project management, with clear objectives, goals, documentation, a conversation trail, a true collaborative workspace. Not just between the IT team, and C-level management as well. They need to be able to see all the planning, organization, project and rap up details that go along with keeping everything running. We need documentation flow to reach our outside consultants effectively and keep the dialog open from start to finish. I don’t think these needs are hard to meet they just take, a platform to help all these things happen on one workspace. SharePoint, Basecamp are some of my favorites I know there are more options out there.<br> 
 
I have distilled my thoughts from the last few weeks (where this has been a constant theme) into a few simple thoughts. This may be the programmer in me, trying to iterate a problem and distill it into simple manageable steps. Which may be a valuable process.<br> 
 
Project management is everything.<br> 
Everything is a project.<br> 
Our customers are king.<br> 
Everyone is our customer.<br> 
Share the secret.<br> 
Don’t overextend.<br> 
Communication is one of your most powerful tools to accomplish these goals.</p>
